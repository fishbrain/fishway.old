# Fishway

Fishway is Fishbrain's tool for planning and supporting our engineers' career development. The tool was first introduced by Medium and you can read more about it in Medium's [growth framework documentation](https://medium.com/s/engineering-growth-framework). The core of Fishway is adopted from Medium's Snowflake tool, but customised to serve Fishbrain's needs.
